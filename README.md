# Nikhil's Dotfiles

Managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io) which will need to be installed on the system. Works fine on macOS and Ubuntu which are the only two OSes I use these days. Needs [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage runtimes (will be installed at bootstrap).

```bash
# This should run bootstrap
yadm clone git@github.com:afreeorange/dotfiles.git
yadm decrypt

# Re-run if things changae
udf
yadm bootstrap

# Redo yadm if you borked things somehow.
hose-yadm
```

## Some Executables

In `.bin` or in the [elaborate bash configuration](https://github.com/afreeorange/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/bash)
## Other

Glyph for `vim` code hierarchy â”Š
